# Deep_Dive_Debouncing_Throttling
ðŸ“¦ Debouncing &amp; Throttling in JavaScript - This repo contains custom implementations of Debouncing and Throttling

### âœ… What is Debouncing?

Debouncing ensures a function is **only called after a certain delay** once the last event has fired. It's useful when you want to **wait for the user to stop doing something**.

### ðŸ“¦ Example Use Case

- API call after the user **stops typing** in a search field.
- Save form input after a user **pauses**.


Throttling ensures a function is only called once in a fixed time interval, even if the event is triggered multiple times.

ðŸ“¦ Example Use Case
Handle window resize or scroll events efficiently.

Prevent excessive API calls from button mashing.
